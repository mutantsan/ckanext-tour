# ckanext-tour

ckanext-tour is a CKAN extension that provides a guided tour feature for CKAN instances. It allows users to create interactive tours to showcase different features and functionalities of a CKAN instance.

## Features
- Create interactive tours with step-by-step instructions
- Highlight specific elements on CKAN pages
- Customize tour appearance and behavior
- Easily manage and edit tours through the CKAN admin interface

Once the extension is installed and enabled, you can start creating tours through the CKAN admin interface. Tours can be associated with specific pages or sections of your CKAN portal, and you can define multiple steps for each tour.

To start a tour, users can click on a tour trigger button or it can be started automatically, when user visits the specified page. The tour will guide them through the specified steps, highlighting the relevant elements on each page.

Each step contains next information:

- Title: A brief, engaging headline that summarizes the step.
- Query: Query to specify which element we're highlighting
- Intro: Text, that will be displayed on a step card
- Position: Specifies the placement of step card (top, right, bottom, left).
- Image: Visuals to complement the text, illustrate points, or add visual interest. GIF animation could be used here.
